# CAMPUS-NETWORK-DESIGN
Designed and deployed a scalable campus network using Cisco Packet Tracer, integrating OSPF, VLANs, and DHCP for efficient routing and IP management. Configured core routers, MLS, and servers (DHCP, email, web). Established secure access with ACLs, SSH, and NAT/PAT. Ensured seamless, high-performance connectivity for all departments and hostels.
Campus Network Development & Deployment

Project Summary: Designed and deployed a fully functional campus network using Cisco Packet Tracer, incorporating advanced networking concepts to ensure efficiency, reliability, and security across multiple sections.
Network Infrastructure:
Utilized 3 routers, 1 Multilayer Switch (MLS), and 7 Layer 2 switches to establish a robust and scalable network backbone.
Configured OSPF routing protocol to enable dynamic route optimization and seamless communication between network segments.
Integrated ISP connectivity with the core router to facilitate internet access across the entire campus.
Hostel Connectivity:
Created dedicated networks for Boys' and Girls' Hostels, ensuring high-speed wireless access via strategically placed access points.
Implemented dynamic IP addressing using a DHCP server, reducing administrative overhead and supporting seamless device onboarding.
Departmental Networks:
Segmented departments such as Library, IT Lab, Faculty, Accounts & Management, and Placement Cell into VLANs, improving security and traffic management.
Leveraged Switched Virtual Interfaces (SVI) to assign unique IP subnets, ensuring efficient inter-VLAN routing.
Designed a layered architecture with Layer 2 switches interconnected through an MLS for centralized control and monitoring.
Server Room Configuration:
Deployed essential servers to support campus operations:
DHCP Server for dynamic IP allocation.
Email Server for internal communication.
Web Server to host campus-specific web applications and resources.
Security and Optimization:
Enabled SSH for secure remote access by authorized personnel.
Applied Access Control Lists (ACLs) to restrict unauthorized access to critical network resources and sensitive data.
Configured NAT/PAT on the core router to facilitate private-to-public IP address translation for secure internet connectivity.
Technical Expertise:
Proficient in advanced networking concepts, including VLANs, OSPF, NAT/PAT, ACLs, and wireless network setup.
Skilled in integrating wired and wireless technologies into a cohesive and secure network design.
Experienced in troubleshooting and optimizing network performance to meet organizational needs.
Project Highlights:
Delivered a future-proof network design capable of supporting scalability and operational demands.
